# SheepGame
*Game Where you are a sheep that is trying to escape the herd. Escape the pattern of the herd without touching any one.* 

### Scope/Plan:

1. Make the Player movement, 8-way with a really smooth movement.//
	1. WASD Movement. //
	2. Acceleration and Deceleration to make it harder to control.//
2. Make the sheep, which kill the player when touched.//
3. Else, the player is bounced off. DECIDE.
4. Create a system to summon those sheep in a hand-made pattern.
5. Then make levels.

## This prototype has been tried without the spawning system as I found the main loop quite boring upon making the player and the sheep and trying to escape hand-made stuff even. The purpose of the prototype has been fulfilled: 1. It helped me in getting my hands a little dirty with godot after a while 2. It helped me check whether the idea is worth it or not before spending a lot of time in it. GG's.
