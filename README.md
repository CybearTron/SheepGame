# SheepGame
*Game Where you are a sheep that is trying to escape the herd. Escape the pattern of the herd without touching any one.* 

### Scope/Plan:

1. Make the Player movement, 8-way with a really smooth movement. 
2. Make the sheep, which kill the player when touched.
3. Else, the player is bounced off. DECIDE.
4. Create a system to summon those sheep in a hand-made pattern.
5. Then make levels.
